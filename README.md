# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-JAVA
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java, featuring a 3x3 grid where two players take turns placing 'X' or 'O'. The game checks for a win when three identical symbols align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It also handles draw situations when the grid is full with no winner. Input validation ensures only valid moves are accepted, and the console interface provides a straightforward and engaging gameplay experience. The project is ideal for beginners learning Java or anyone looking to enjoy a classic game.
